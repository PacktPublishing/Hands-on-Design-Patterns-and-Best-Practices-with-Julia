This is the code repository for [Hands-On Design Patterns and Best Practices with Julia ](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/hands-on-design-patterns-and-best-practices-with-julia-9781838646615), published by Packt.

**Proven solutions to common problems in software design for Julia 1.x**

## What is this book about?
Design patterns are fundamental techniques for developing reusable and maintainable code. They provide a set of proven solutions that allow developers to solve problems in software development quickly. This book will demonstrate how to leverage design patterns with real-world applications.


This book covers the following exciting features:
* Master the Julia language features that are key to developing large-scale software applications 
* Discover design patterns to improve overall application architecture and design 
* Develop reusable programs that are modular, extendable, performant, and easy to maintain 
* Weigh up the pros and cons of using different design patterns for use cases 
* Explore methods for transitioning from object-oriented programming to using equivalent or more advanced Julia techniques

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
abstract type Formatter end
struct IntegerFormatter <: Formatter end
struct FloatFormatter <: Formatter end
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for beginner to intermediate-level Julia programmers who want to enhance their skills in designing and developing large-scale applications.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-12).
### Software and Hardware List
| Chapter | Software required | OS required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 1-12 | Julia Version 1.3.0 or above | Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (Any) |

## Errata

Page numbers below refer to the printed version. E-copy page numbers are slightly different.

* Page 39 and 49:
Before running the using Calculator command, he/she can first go to the Pkg mode (by pressing the ] key) and then run the dev Calculator command.  For example:
 ```
        (@v1.4) pkg> dev Calculator

        Path `/Users/tomkwong/.julia/dev/Calculator` exists and looks like the correct package. Using existing path.

          Resolving package versions...

           Updating `~/.julia/environments/v1.4/Project.toml`

          [17fd2872] + Calculator v0.1.0 [`~/.julia/dev/Calculator`]

           Updating `~/.julia/environments/v1.4/Manifest.toml`

          [17fd2872] + Calculator v0.1.0 [`~/.julia/dev/Calculator`]
```

* Page 54:
The `subtypetree` function does not work when there is cycle in the type hierarchy. It is generally not a problem with the exception that the `Any` type is a subtype of itself. So, running `subtypetree(Any)` would get into an infinite loop. Please see [Chapter02/subtypetree2.jl](Chapter02/subtypetree2.jl) for a more robust version.

* Page 67:
The hierarchy of numerical types in the diagram erroneously lists the concrete type `Bright` as a subtype of `Integer`; there is no such type that ships with Julia. For completeness, the diagram should have included the concrete type `BigInt` among the subtypes of the abstract type `Signed`.

* Page 110:
The signature of the first `explode` function under Using type parameters section should take `<: Any` rather than just `Any`.
```
function explode(things::AbstractVector{<:Any})
```

Because every type is a subtype of `Any`, it is more idiomatic to omit the parametric part and use with a simpler syntax:
```
function explode(things::AbstractVector)
```

* Page 219:
The `vendor_id` of the `TripPayment` has the wrong type. It should be `Int` rather than `String`.

* Page 249:
The second image on page number 249 is incorrect. The correct image is as follows:
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1159782/93007143-19430980-f51a-11ea-9982-5fb58fc5ed01.png">

* Page 318, 352, 494:
These pages contain typos where "accessor" was misspelled as "assessor".
