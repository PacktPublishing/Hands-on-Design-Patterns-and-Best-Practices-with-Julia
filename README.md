## What is this book about?
Design patterns are fundamental techniques for developing reusable and maintainable code. They provide a set of proven solutions that allow developers to solve problems in software development quickly. This book will demonstrate how to leverage design patterns with real-world applications.


This book covers the following exciting features:
* Master the Julia language features that are key to developing large-scale software applications 
* Discover design patterns to improve overall application architecture and design 
* Develop reusable programs that are modular, extendable, performant, and easy to maintain 
* Weigh up the pros and cons of using different design patterns for use cases 
* Explore methods for transitioning from object-oriented programming to using equivalent or more advanced Julia techniques
